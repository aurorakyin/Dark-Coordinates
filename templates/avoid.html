<h1>How to avoid contact with ghosts</h1>
<br>

<h3>there are some place in a house you should try to avoid</h3>

<ul>
    <li>mirrors (especially at night!)</li>
    <li>dark cramped bathrooms (especially when you hear water dripping!)</li>
    <li>attics and basements (especially when there are stories about how they are haunted!)</li>
    <li>under the bed (especially when you hear breathing from underneath!)</li>
</ul>

<h5> but this probably looks too familiar if you just read how to get in contact with ghosts, so here are some other ideas!</h5>
<ul>
    <li>salt and glutinous rice (they are tasty and powerful)</li>
    <li>people (because how can one ghost fight a crowd of humans!)</li>
    <li>wait until sunrise (hang on just a little bit longer!)</li>
    <li>pretend you are one of them (they are not as smart as you think...?)</li>

</ul>
