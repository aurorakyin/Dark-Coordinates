# Designing Dark Coordinates
A “design document” for your project in the form of a Markdown file called DESIGN.md that discusses, technically, how you implemented your project and why you made the design decisions you did. Your design document should be at least several paragraphs in length. Whereas your documentation is meant to be a user’s manual, consider your design document your opportunity to give the staff a technical tour of your project underneath its hood.
## Overview
we used Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We implemented this project by referencing past HW's that we did, such as finance and homepage.  

## app.py
Our app.py is based off of the app.py from the finance HW, and we maintained similar methods for the login and register portions of the app.py. We also added routes for all of our HTML pages, such as Directory, How to Avoid Contact with Ghosts, How to Contact Ghosts, Me, and each of our four ghost stories.
